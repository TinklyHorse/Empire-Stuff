This is a very bare version of my original mod for Klaus. It was originally made for Warhammer 2 using Cryswar's guides. This uses the unit and legendary lord guides. There may be more issues with the full version but even with all the skills, effects and ancillaries removed, I can't spawn him into the game. Here are the exact problems:

1. The game crashes (sometimes the entire computer if I don't close the game fast enough) during the Immortal Empires loading screen. The bar barely moves.
2. While Klaus appears in battles, the game layers a black version of Karl Franz's armour on him (this isn't as important as the first issue).

If anyone can fix these, specifically the first issue, that would be fantastic because I can't figure it out.
